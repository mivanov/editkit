F-or non-development installs we *highly* recommend using our standard
installation packages. Details here:

  http://localwiki.org/install

These packages are much easier to keep updated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following install instructions are geared for development setups or
non-Ubuntu installs.

1.  Prerequisites: python imaging library, python lxml bindings,
python-setuptools, and virtualenv.  Here's how we get these packages in Ubuntu
10.04 LTS:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-lxml python-imaging
    $ sudo easy_install --upgrade virtualenv

2.  Create a virtualenv. For more info, see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
*Note*: We store some important site-specific data in the virtualenv, so don't
delete it without first backing up the share/editkit directory inside it.

    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages env
    
    Activate the new environment. Run all of the following commands in this environment:

    $ source env/bin/activate

3.  Install the editkit package and its dependencies:

	(env)$ python setup.py install

4.  Initialize the EditKit install:

	(env)$ editkit-manage setup_all

You are now done configuring and installing things! You can start the built-in
Django development server:
    
    (env)$ editkit-manage runserver

Hooray!  You can visit the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Note: For security/efficiency, the built-in server listens on 127.0.0.1 only.
      For real deployments you'll want to set up apache.
      See https://dev.localwiki.org for more instructions.

Note: You'll want to run source env/bin/activate every time you want to access
      the editkit-manage command.


=== Development note ===

If you're hacking on the code, you'll probably want to run, inside the virtualenv:

    (env)$ python setup.py develop

Instead of 'install'.  This makes the code update without having to run
'setup.py install' every time!

You'll also probably want to set DEBUG to False in share/conf/localsettings.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've really only tested things on Ubuntu Server Edition 10.04 LTS.  It should
be very possible to run this on any Unix-y system.  You'll just need to hunt
down the correct prerequisites for Step 1.

Help us document this stuff!  Add something to https://dev.localwiki.org or
the github wiki.


== Database Note ==

This setup uses SQLite, which is perfect for small wiki projects but is
probably not sufficient for a larger site. You should be able to use any
supported Django database. If you'd like to do something more specialized,
please see the general Django install instructions here:
