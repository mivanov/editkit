Upgrading
=========

When a new version of EditKit is released, you should upgrade to it. If you
installed using the Ubuntu packages, then upgrading to a new release is very
simple.

Run these commands to upgrade::

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   
This will upgrade all of your packages, including EditKit. All of your data
will be preserved during the upgrade.

If you installed manually, read the upgrade instructions here:
